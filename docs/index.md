# Introduction

This website is about _hyperlinked twin websites_ of GitHub project repositories.

!!! note ""

    The icons :material-lightbulb: and :material-lightbulb-outline: toggle between light and dark mode.
    The present website also supports auto-toggling, indicated by :material-lightbulb-auto:.

Hyperlinked twins support _precise name-based code navigation using ordinary web browsers!_
The hyperlinks and highlighting make it much easier to browse, explore, and understand code
in unfamiliar repositories or languages.

!!! tip

    Jump between references and declarations just by clicking on names.

A paper about generation of hyperlinked twins was 
[presented at SLE](https://2023.splashcon.org/home/sle-2023#program) in October 2023:

> [Online Name-Based Navigation for Software Meta-languages](https://pdmosses.github.io/papers/Mosses2023ONN/sle23-final.pdf "PDF")

The sources of hyperlinked twin websites are generated by [Spoofax] from raw code on GitHub.
The aim is for a future release of Spoofax to support generation of hyperlinked twins
for code in all [Spoofax meta-languages].

The [published websites](examples.md) are built from the generated files
using [Material for MkDocs].[^plugin]

[^plugin]: The [mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin] overrides the built-in title transformation
    [currently made by MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/2086>).

!!! warning

    The Spoofax implementation and the generated website have not yet been reviewed by the Spoofax developers.
