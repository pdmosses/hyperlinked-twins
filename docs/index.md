# Introduction

This website is about _hyperlinked twin websites_ of language project repositories on GitHub.

!!! note ""

    The icons :material-lightbulb: and :material-lightbulb-outline: toggle between light and dark mode.

Hyperlinked twins support _precise name-based code navigation_ using ordinary web browsers:

- Simply click on a name reference to jump to the corresponding declaration.
- Hover[^mobile] over a name to show the location of the declaration.
- Click on a declaration to jump to the first reference to it (if any),
  or hover over it to show the locations of all the (direct) references to it.

[^mobile]: Mobile devices with touch screens don't usually recognise hovering gestures.

A paper about generation of hyperlinked twins is 
[to be presented at SLE](https://2023.splashcon.org/home/sle-2023#event-overview) in October 2023:

> [Online Name-Based Navigation for Software Meta-languages](https://pdmosses.github.io/papers/Mosses2023ONN/sle23-final.pdf "PDF")

The sources of hyperlinked twin websites are generated by [Spoofax] from raw code on GitHub.

The [published websites](examples) are built from the generated files
using [Material for MkDocs].[^plugin]

[^plugin]: The [mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin] overrides the built-in title transformation
    [currently made by MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/2086>).

The aim is for a future release of Spoofax to support generation of hyperlinked twins
for code in all [Spoofax meta-languages].

!!! warning

    The Spoofax implementation and the generated website have not yet been reviewed by the Spoofax developers.
